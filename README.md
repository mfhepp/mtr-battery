This is a small open hardware project for a battery holder for two AAAA batteries for buffering the RTC of the Mountain Topper MTR-5B ham radio transceiver.

The originally installed coin cell holder cannot provide a sufficient capacity and causes start-up problems once the battery is discharged below a certain level.
